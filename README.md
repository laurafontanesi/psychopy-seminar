## Course Description
[Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) is an [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) for the presentation of psychological experiments. While it was mostly designed to be used in the lab (also in conjunction with neuroimaging techniques such as EEG or fMRI), it is now also possible to run Psychopy experiments [online](https://www.psychopy.org/online/online.html).

The goal of this course is to introduce you to Psychopy so that you learn to build experiments for your current and future experimental research projects.

This course is for *anyone who wants to learn how to program experiments* in Psychopy and no prior programming knowledge is required.

## Weekly Programming Assignments (WPAs) and final assignment
During each class, you will work on a series of programming tasks called **Weekly Programming Assignments (WPA)**. You can do this alone, but I encourage you to discuss and/or work with your peers. It is however very important that each student's work is his/her own. Do not turn in any assignments that you did not contribute to or do not fully understand.

By the end of the lesson, you should email your WPA to me to receive credit. While I will keep track of how often you submit your WPAs, I will *not* grade them. You should however try to reply to each of the questions in the assignment. When you are not able to, I will be there to answer any doubt or question about the code. These assignments are meant as a practice to learn-by-doing the class' material.

As a final assignment, you will have to program your own experiment. More info on this will be provided later during the course.

## Grading
This is a pass / fail course. To pass the course, you should turn in your WPAs, miss not more than 2 classes, and pass the final assignment.

**Final note: Ask, ask, ask!**
Thats why I'm here. If you don't know what you are doing or why something doesn't work (or does work), or maybe you do know what you are doing but you want to make it more efficient, please do not hesitate to ask questions. As this is meant to be a more practical seminar and we are somewhat limited by the online format, it is very important that we all make an effort to communicate with each other.
